# Goroutines & Channels talks
This is the repo for the Goroutines & Channels talks. 

These slides are built with go present, as it allows us to run `Go` code straight into the slide deck.

https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present

To see them and run the code examples locally you must:

- Have `Go` installed
- Checkout the slides repository

- Install present locally with `go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present`
- Run `present -use_playground` from the terminal
